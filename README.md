# The BESSPIN Project
This repository collects all the open source repositories created or extended as a part of [Galois](https://galois.com)'s [_Balancing the Evaluation of System Security Properties with Industrial Needs (BESSPIN)_](https://galois.com/project/besspin) project, part of the [DARPA SSITH](https://www.darpa.mil/program/ssith) program. This is an exhaustive list of the resources released as open source, which include a wide range of artifacts ranging from soft-core RISC-V FPGA bitstreams to [FETT bug bounty contest](https://fett.darpa.mil) web interfaces, and is meant to collect high-level information about those resources in one place. Users of these resources should generally check out only the individual repositories applicable to their interests, rather than the entire (quite large) set represented here.

The following are short descriptions of all the BESSPIN repositories and the resources contained within them; each individual repository contains further documentation about its own contents, in addition to licensing information. In the order displayed on GitHub, these are:
